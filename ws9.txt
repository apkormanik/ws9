Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.	2005-10-14

Many examples don't work.  Talks about features not in the product or that work very differently.  Also not written for developers.  I agree with the other review--it really is for beginners only.	2005-10-14

Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an \\"insider\\"...if you are looking for alternatives to the \\"Washington Consensus\\" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory.	2005-10-14

Guides you through basic webpart development in C# (when you register the book you can get code in VB if you desire). The book also discusses in straightforward terms debugging, deployment of webparts, code access security, targeting audiences and personalizing content. Plus it is only 175 pages, so it won't collapse your bookshelf.	2005-10-14

It attempts to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it is written from Hitler's point of view. The events are narrated in the order Hitler experienced them, and as he experienced them. Thus one gets a vivid feeling of being present as history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historians and biographers. Of course Irving also includes a huge amount of information gleaned from sometimes exclusive interviews with witnesses and participants. This book has been controversial since it first appeared in the 1970s. It has been publicly criticized by many historians. But it has also been tacitly praised by them, insoar as they have borrowed heavily from Irving's research.	2005-10-14

However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House.  One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />	2005-10-14

He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.	2005-10-14
